- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeaZee01
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, game development, 3D modelling and video editing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Swift programming language for app development, and C# + Javascript for game development.
- 💞️ I’m actively collaborating on the development of Notsify, a multipurpose note taking application, as well working as a indie developer on a 2D platformer game called Spirit-Kid.
- 📫 How to reach me: dlmeyernz@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: N/A
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also trying to learn French at the moment. Not exactly making things easy for myself!
